    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

Namespaces provide encapsulation and avoid naming conflicts between your code and a module or across modules.\n",

    "## Questions for Revision\n",
    "\n",
    "Try answering the following questions to test your understanding of the topics covered in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A function is a reusable set of instructions that takes one or more inputs, performs some operations, and often returns an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the benefits of using functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions can accept zero or more values as inputs (also knows as arguments or parameters). Arguments help us write flexible functions that can perform the same operations on different values. Further, functions can return a result that can be stored in a variable or used in other expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are some built-in functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python contains many in-built functions like print, len\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How do you define a function in Python? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The round brackets or parentheses () and colon : after the function's name. Both are essential parts of the syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the body of a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function's body contains an indented block of statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. When are the statements in the body of a function executed?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The statements inside a function's body are not executed when the function is defined. To execute the statements, we need to call or invoke the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is meant by calling or invoking a function? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are function arguments? How are they useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions can accept zero or more values as inputs (also knows as arguments or parameters). Arguments help us write flexible functions that can perform the same operations on different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you store the result of a function in a variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "* unctions can return a result that can be stored in a variable or used in other expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the purpose of the `return` keyword in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* To retrun the value from the function which can store the results in variables for easier comparison. We can do this using the return statement\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Can you return multiple values from a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Can a `return` statement be used inside an `if` block or a `for` loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Can the `return` keyword be used outside a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* No, you cannot use return outside a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is scope in a programming region? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Scope refers to the region within the code where a particular variable is visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you define a variable inside a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variables inside a functions are defined using assignment operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What are local & global variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every function (or class definition) defines a scope within Python. Variables defined in this scope are called local variables. Variables that are available everywhere are called global variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "17. Can you access the variables defined inside a function outside its body? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scope rules allow you to use the same variable names in different functions without sharing values from one to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What do you mean by the statement \"a function defines a scope within Python\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every function (or class definition) defines a scope within Python. Variables defined in this scope are called local variables. Variables that are available everywhere are called global variables. Scope rules allow you to use the same variable names in different functions without sharing values from one to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Do for and while loops define a scope, like functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variables declared in for-loop blocks, and while-loop blocks are not local variables, and stay in scope outside of the block. \n",
    "\n",
    "20. Do if-else blocks define a scope, like functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variables declared in if-statements are not local variables, and stay in scope outside of the block. \n",
    "\n",
    "21. What are optional function arguments & default values? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optional Arguments are which we can skip while declaring the function arguments and Default values are, If the aruguments are not passed in the function it will take the default value when we have created a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. Why should the required arguments appear before the optional arguments in a function definition?\n",
    "\n",
    "* As per python rules non-default argument has to follows default argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "23. How do you invoke a function with named arguments? Illustrate with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \n",
    "```\n",
    "emi1 = loan_emi(\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "24. Can you split a function invocation into multiple lines?\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can also split function invocation into multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Write a function that takes a number and rounds it up to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  ```\n",

    "    7    \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "26. What are modules in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Modules are files containing Python code (variables, functions, classes, etc.). They provide a way of organizing the code for large Python projects into files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. What is a Python library?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python provides a function for it (along with thousands of other functions) as part of the Python Standard Library. \n",
    "\n",
    "28. What is the Python Standard Library?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python provides a function for it (along with thousands of other functions) as part of the Python Standard Library. \n",

    "\n",
    "30. How do you install a third-party library?\n",
    "\n",
    "* by doing a pip install.\n",
    "\n",
    "31. What is a module namespace? How is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Namespaces provide encapsulation and avoid naming conflicts between your code and a module or across modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. What problems would you run into if Python modules did not provide namespaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Namespaces provide encapsulation and avoid naming conflicts between your code and a module or across modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. How do you import a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "* by using import Ex: import math\n",
    "\n",
    "34. How do you use a function from an imported module? Illustrate with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* by using the modulename . function name. Example math.ceil(1.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "35. Can you invoke a function inside the body of another function? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yes you can invoke anopther function inside a function. Excample below\n",

    "    emi = math.ceil(emi)\n",
    "    return emi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "36. What is the single responsibility principle, and how does it apply while writing functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ideally, a function should do one thing and one thing only. As a rule of thumb, try to limit your functions to 10 lines of code or less. Good programmers always write short, simple, and readable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. What some characteristics of well-written functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using functions to build other functions is a great way to reuse code and implement complex business logic while still keeping the code small, understandable, and manageable. \n",
    "\n",
    "38. Can you use if statements or while loops within a function? Illustrate with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yes: Please see below example. \n",
