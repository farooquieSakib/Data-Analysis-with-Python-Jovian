    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc., instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

    "## Branching with `if`, `else` and `elif`\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of programming languages is *branching*: the ability to make decisions and execute a different set of statements based on whether one or more conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `if` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, branching is implemented using the `if` statement, which is written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    statement1\n",
    "    statement2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` can be a value, variable or expression. If the condition evaluates to `True`, then the statements within the *`if` block* are executed. Notice the four spaces before `statement1`, `statement2`, etc. The spaces inform Python that these statements are associated with the `if` statement above. This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called *indentation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Indentation**: Python relies heavily on *indentation* (white space before a statement) to define code structure. This makes Python code easy to read and understand. You can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces. \n",

    "## Questions for Revision\n",
    "\n",
    "Try answering the following questions to test your understanding of the topics covered in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is branching in programming languages?\n",
    "\n",
    "* branching is the ability to make decisions and execute a different set of statements based on whether one or more conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the purpose of the `if` statement in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the condition evaluates to True, then the statements within the if block are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the syntax of the `if` statement? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "*       ```\n",
    "        if a_number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "            print(\"We're inside an if block\")\n",
    "            print('The given number {} is even.'.format(a_number))\n",
    "        ```\n",
    " \n",
    "4. What is indentation? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "* This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is an indented block of statements?\n",
    " \n",
    "*  Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the Tab key once to add 4 spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do you perform indentation in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pressing Tab again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press Shift+Tab will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What happens if some code is not indented correctly?\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. What happens when the condition within the `if` statement evaluates to `True`? What happens if the condition evaluates for `false`?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If condition evaluates to True, the statements in the if block are executed. If the condition is `False` then it exits the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you check if a number is even?\n",
    "\n",
    "* We use the comparison operator == check if the remainder is 0, which tells us whether the number is even, i.e., divisible by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the purpose of the `else` statement in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If condition evaluates to True, the statements in the if block are executed. If it evaluates to False, the statements in the else block are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the syntax of the `else` statement? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```\n",
    "    if a_number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        print('The given number {} is even.'.format(a_number))\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print('The given number {} is odd.'.format(a_number))    \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Write a program that prints different messages based on whether a number is positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ```\n",
    "        num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "        if num > 0:\n",
    "           print(\"Positive number\")\n",
    "        elif num == 0:\n",
    "           print(\"Zero\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "           print(\"Negative number\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    " \n",
    "13. Can the `else` statement be used without an `if` statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "* No\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the `elif` statement in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python also provides an elif statement (short for \"else if\") to chain a series of conditional blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the syntax of the `elif` statement? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```if today == 'Sunday':\n",
    "         print(\"Today is the day of the sun.\")\n",

    "     ``` \n",
    "\n",
    "16. Write a program that prints different messages for different months of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    ```\n",

    "17. Write a program that uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements together.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  ```\n",
    "        if a_number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "            print('{} is divisible by 2'.format(a_number))\n",

    "20. What is the difference between a chain of `if`, `elif`, `elif`… statements and a chain of `if`, `if`, `if`… statements? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  the condition in `if`, `elif`, `elif`… statements, `if` evaluates to true then it will come out of the loop and not execute the `elif`, same goes with the `elif` stmts. As soon as the condition becomes true it will come out of the loop.\n",
    "* In `if`, `if`, `if`… statements, it will execute the `if` condition one by one is respective of the True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. Can non-boolean conditions be used with `if` statements? Give some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The conditions do not necessarily have to be booleans. In fact, a condition can be any value. The value is converted into a boolean automatically using the bool operator. This means that falsy values like 0, '', {}, [], etc. evaluate to False and all other values evaluate to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",

    "\n",
    "22. What are nested conditional statements? How are they useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code inside an if block can also include an if statement inside it. This pattern is called nesting and is used to check for another condition after a particular condition holds true.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Give an example of nested conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \n",
    "```\n",
    "    a_number = 15\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if a_number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        print(\"{} is even\".format(a_number))\n",

    "            print(\"{} is not divisibule by 5\".format(a_number))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "24. Why is it advisable to avoid nested conditional statements?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nested if, else statements are often confusing to read and prone to human error. It's good to avoid nesting whenever possible, or limit the nesting to 1 or 2 levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. What is the shorthand `if` conditional expression? \n",
    "\n",
    "*  A frequent use case of the if statement involves testing a condition and setting a variable's value based on the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. What is the syntax of the shorthand `if` conditional expression? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  ``` x = true_value if condition ```\n",
    "\n",
    "27. What is the difference between the shorthand `if` expression and the regular `if` statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "* It has the same behavior \n",
    "\n",
    "28. What is a statement in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A statement is an instruction that can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. What is an expression in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* An expression is some code that evaluates to a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. What is the difference between statements and expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most expressions can be executed as statements, but not all statements are expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "31. Is every statement an expression? Give an example or counterexample.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No not all statements are expressions. For example, the regular if statement is not an expression since it does not evaluate to a value. It merely performs some branching in the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "32. Is every expression a statement? Give an example or counterexample.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most expressions can be executed as statements. An expression is anything that can appear on the right side of the assignment operator =. You can use this as a test for checking whether something is an expression or not. You'll get a syntax error if you try to assign something that is not an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. What is the purpose of the pass statement in `if` blocks?\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use the pass statement to do nothing and avoid getting an error as if statements cannot be empty, there must be at least one statement in every if and elif block\n",
    "\n",
    "34. What is iteration or looping in programming languages? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Iteration is a powerful technique because it gives computers a massive advantage over human beings in performing thousands or even millions of repetitive operations really fast. With just 4-5 lines of code, we were able to multiply 100 numbers almost instantly. The same code can be used to multiply a thousand numbers (just change the condition to i <= 1000) in a few seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. What are the two ways for performing iteration in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "*  two ways to perform iteration in Python are by using while loops and for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "36. What is the purpose of the `while` statement in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Statements in the code block under while are executed repeatedly as long as the condition evaluates to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. What is the syntax of the `white` statement in Python? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* while loops have the following syntax:\n",
